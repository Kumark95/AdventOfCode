# Notes

## WIP ideas
- Queue with Sender, Receiver, Pulse
- Dict with the name -> Module
- List with inputs and outputs (names from input)

- When dequeue
    - Update Receiver state: (Pulse, Module sender)
	- Loop Receiver outputs
        - Enqueue?
        - Somehow check if it should send the signal to a given output
