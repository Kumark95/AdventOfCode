# Notes

## Part 2
- The `rx` module has only one input, a conjunction module
- The inputs of this conjunction module are also conjunction modules
- For a conjunction module to send a low pulse, all its inputs must have sent a high pulse
- The problem requires tracking how many button presses is required for each conjunction module and then calculate the LCM
