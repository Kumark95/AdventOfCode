# Notes

## Part 1
- Quick an easy, just follow the instructions

## Part 2
- The original interface expected a long in the solver signature. This puzzle requires a higher range, and thus ulong was used
- The solver for part one was redone using the method developed in part two using a range of a single value and expecting the number of accepted combinations to be just one
