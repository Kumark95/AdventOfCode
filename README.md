# Advent of Code
Advent of Code (<https://adventofcode.com>) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

This repo contains my own solutions using C#. I try to focus on readability, performance, and testing new features of the language.


## Requirements
.NET 8.0 Runtime


## Usage
```csharp
dotnet run <Year> <Day>
```

Or update the `Core/Properties/launchSettings.json` file to launch via Visual Studio
